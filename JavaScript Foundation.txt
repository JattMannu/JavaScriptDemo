Values and Types
var t = 'hi'        | Stored as String
var t = 'bye'       | Stored as String
var t = false       | Stored as boolean
var t = null        | Stored as null
var t = undefined   | Stored as null != undefined . undefined is a unknown state of the object.

Operators
Examples of Operators are /,*,-,+.
To for an expression we need Operators.

+ is a Operator
3 + 5 is a Expression
3 + 5; is a Statement


Variables

var temp1 = 1;
var temp2 = temp1;

temp2 is refering to 1
temp1 is refering to 1
A Variable can only refer to value.
Note : A Variable can never refer to a Variable.

New methods learnt.
var a = Math.random();
var b = prompt();


Topic 1.4 : Objects and Properties

What is a Object?
A simple sort of value that has the ability to store many Properties.
A property is a key and value pair.
We say an object "contains" other values.
In javascript all values are objects.

What is a "Object Literal"? => Literally an object.
{}

What is the dot notation?
var obj = {};
obj.x = 9; this means obj['x']
Console.log(obj.x);

What is bracket notation?
var obj = {};
obj['x'] = 9;
Console.log(obj['x']);

Relationship between dot notation and bracket notation?
obj.x = 9; this means obj['x']
Limitation of dot notation is obj[var1] cannot be converted to dot notation
if you type obj.var1 it means obj['var1'] converted ouu Variable var1 into string literal.

When to use dot notation?
limited features.

When to use bracket notation?
Very flexiabled we can add speical characters.
obj['~/ [."4'] = 9
Console.log(obj['~/ [."4']) will print 9.

How to convert from dot notation to braket notation?

How to convert from bracket notation to dot notation?

How to make property key ?

How to add special characters to property keys?
via bracket notation
or 
var obj = {
    x : 9,    //We do not need to 'x' quote x because it is a string but if use speical chars
    '~/ [."4' : 'cat' //needed the quote for the key.
};

How are key kept?
obj['0'] = 'test1';  // the key 0 is kept as string.
obj[0] = 'test1'  // they key 0 is still kept at string.
All keys are converted into string before stored.


Arrays Started.

Sample Code:
var obj = {}; //when obj is an object

obj['x'] = 9;
obj[0] = 'cat';  //0 is saved as string.
Console.log(obj['x']); // Prints 9
Console.log(obj[0]); // Prints cat

for(var k in obj){
    Console.log(k); // Prints x and 0. Print all the keys.
}

If obj is a array?

var arr = []; //when arr is an array.

arr['x'] = 9;
arr[0] = 'cat';  //0 is saved as string.
Console.log(arr['x']); // Prints 9
Console.log(arr[0]); // Prints cat

for(var k in obj){
    Console.log(k); // Prints x and 0. Print all the keys.
}

No difference in array and object in this code.
So what is the difference?
Array has a few optimization.Making them good for storing sequence of infromation in integer keys.

Console.log(arr.length); // This will print 1. 
all dot notation can be convert to bracket notation
Console.log(arr['length']); // This will print 1. 

enumerable means countable.
unenumerable means uncountable.
Array's length property is unenumerable there for it does not show up in the for loop.

Why is the length 1 but not 2 ?
Only the integer keys are counted in the length. Any other are ignored.


Interesting fact.
If you want to travers all the integer key in the array.
We must use for(int i ; i < arr.length; i++) however this wont work for object.
Because an Object does not have the length attribute.So
Console.log(obj.length); //Returns undefined.

Array Completed.
